# Setup

This is a java wrapper for the schunk svh driver
To make it work properly, you have to install the [schunk svh library](https://github.com/Sinker01/schunk_svh_library_windows).

For beginners, I would recommend to install a wsl, and run this project through vscode/IntelliJ with a remote connection to the wsl
